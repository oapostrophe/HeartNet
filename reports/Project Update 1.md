# Project Update 1

1. Software: We plan to use PyTorch and possibly FastAI.

2. Dataset: PTB Diagnostic EKG Database https://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/database/ptbdb/

3. We plan to use a Convolutional Neural Network.  Our inputs will be images of EKG recordings generated from the above dataset.  Our output will be a binary label "MI" (Myocardial Infarction, or heart attack) or "Healthy"
