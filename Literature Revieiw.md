**Summary:** Researchers used a convolutional neural network to achieve 96% accuracy classifying Generalized Anterorior Myocardial Infarction in data from 4 ECG leads.  To combine data from multiple leads in the diagnosis, sub-2d convolutional layers and lead asymmetric pooling layers were used.  The algorithmâ€™s realtime performance was tested on a lightweight embedded system and found to be suitable for application in mobile wearable ECG devices.
