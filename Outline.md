# HeartNet: A mobile app for automatic STEMi detection in EKGs.

The rapid detection of ST-Elevated Myocardial Infarction through 12-lead EKG is one of the most important parts of effective emergency cardiac medicine.

Yet challenges such as limited number of trained providers and overburdened emergency healthcare systems result in large gaps in many systems' rapid STEMi detection capabilities, gaps through which patients slip every day resulting in sub-optimal care and outcomes.

Automatic computer EKG interpretation could potentially fill such gaps; however, the algorithm-based interpretation techniques used on currently existing EKG monitors are famously inaccurate and unreliable.

While the past few years have seen researchers achieve breakthrough accuracy levels in automatic EKG interpretation using neural-network based approaches, such results have failed to be applied to healthcare practice beyond the lab.

We attempted to bridge the gap between research and practice by creating a mobile phone application that allows healthcare providers to easily utilize a neural-network system to accurately detect STEMis in 12-lead EKG printouts.

Challenges in the creation of such an application included the availability of datasets, handling noise and different printout formats, and handling the presentation of STEMis across diverse and complex EKG waveforms.

Our finished application replicated the high level of accuracy seen in previous work in an easily usable form by healthcare providers, suggesting the immediate feasibility of integrating neural-network basedk automatic EKG interpretation to emergency healthcare systems through a mobile phone application.

Ethical considerations for our project included those involved with our data sources, bias in results, and the protocols that may be used for testing and application in clinical practice.
